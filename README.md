# Singleton Design Pattern (.NET)

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Singleton design pattern in C#.

## What is the Singleton Design Pattern?

The Singleton design pattern ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global access point to it. It's useful for scenarios where you need a single, centralized object for tasks like logging, configuration management, or thread pools.

## Benefits:

### **Global Access**: Provides a single point of access to the object's functionality.
### **Resource Efficiency**: Ensures only one instance is created, saving memory.

## Trade-offs:

### **Tight Coupling**: Creates tight coupling between code that uses the singleton.
### **Testability**: Can be difficult to unit test due to global state.

## Project Structure:

### The code for the Singleton class will likely reside in a file named `SingletonClass.cs`.
### Consider including additional files for unit tests `(Program.cs}` to demonstrate the class's behavior.

## Getting Started:

### Explore the Singleton.cs file to understand how the instance is created and accessed.
### Review any unit tests `(Program.cs)` to see how the Singleton's functionality is verified.
